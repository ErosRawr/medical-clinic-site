                    NovaCare Clinic was founded in 2004 with a simple mission: to provide accessible, 
                    high-quality healthcare to families in our community. What began as a small primary 
                    care practice has grown into a comprehensive medical facility serving thousands of 
                    patients annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past two decades, we have expanded our services, welcomed new physicians 
                    to our team, and invested in modern medical technology—all while maintaining our 
                    commitment to personalized, compassionate care. Our growth reflects the trust our 
                    community has placed in us, and we remain dedicated to serving you and your family 
                    for generations to come.
